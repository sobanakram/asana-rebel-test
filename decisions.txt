Hi,
I have attached the solution which I completed for the system, Decisions,

I created Location class to wrap the logic related to locations


1. I used Rails Api and disabled most of the rails plugins which we don't need.
    Because we don't need those plugins.
2. I used static token for api to restrict access. but it is configurable anytime through rails credentials.
    Because we don't have users specific data, otherwise we can have specific token for each user through database.
3. I used Rspec for tests which is widely used plugin it is easy to use.
    I find it useful for writing tests as compared to other alternatives.
4. I used Geocoder gem for searching locations with free to use api service openstreetmaps.
    Because it is free to use without providing any information.

Guideline Questions

1. How do you handle configuration values? What if those values change?
    It depends on the type of configurations, Rails preferred way for these values are Rails credentials, Other than
    these we can use environment variables or we have configurations which needs to be updated frequently than we
    should use database.

2. What happens if we encounter an error with the third-party API integration? Will it also break our application, or are they handled accordingly?
    Those are handled accordingly. As in this application I am using Geocoder which is acting as middle man between
    actual apis and our application and is handling those errors as well.
